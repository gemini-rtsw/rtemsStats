# By default we're conservative and approximate the timing using system ticks.
# The granularity is typically not good enough for precise timing, but it may
# be good enough for your use case.

# If your EPICS setup includes a time service that defines hooks for
# epicsTimeGetCurrentInt, though, feel free to uncomment the following please,
# to get more precise timing
